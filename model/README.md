# Model

This module defines the model of the pipeline.

We have two main interfaces:

* Action : describes an action (e.g. compile some stuff)
* Pipeline : describes how actions are sequentially executed (no support for parralel executions)
* Orchestrator: describes how the action executions are orchestrated.
